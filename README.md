Learning by doing (ok, sometimes I study too).

## Things I like in Tech

* **ECMAScript syntax**: linear learning curve and accessible (ActionScript -> Java -> Javascript).
* **Native performances**: between a Web project and another you really want it (C++ -> Obj-C -> Swift).
* **Web distribution**: show what you've done and fix it in minutes (PHP -> Python -> Node).
* **Functional UIs**: make your code maintainable (React).

## Thoughts on Open Source

I tried to create, and contribute to, some libraries but they never caught on. These days I mostly report bugs and sponsor someone else's projects.
I've been extremely lucky to be able to work for companies with strong support to Open Source (Canonical - maker of Ubuntu, Microsoft and GitHub).

We stand on the shoulders of giants for everything we do. Open Source helped make this more obvious and might be what will bring collaboration to the forefront of the political agenda. Life is not a zero-sum game and we are all in this together.
